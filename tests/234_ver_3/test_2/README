test with four molecules from the qm17 dataset. These four are in turn randomly selected from the subset of the molecules I have generated from qm17 dataset (first, 100-Means  --> then 100 molecules, which are as close as possible to the centers of the mensioned molecules).

Here, the molecules in the folders are simply named arbitrarity.
The names of them should be read in from the file *.csv as is.
This is the different format from qm17 dataset, where the molecules are listed by 6-digits numbers in *csv and many other stupid things also there.
